# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice**. It includes problems solved from LeetCode, Codewars, textbooks, and self-study exercises, organized by topic and problem name.

---

## Repository Structure

Each problem or topic is stored in its own folder with the naming convention:
"<number>.<Topic>_<ProblemName>"


For example:
1.Go_Hash_Tables_With_Separate_Chaining/
2.Java_Binary_Search_Tree_Insertion/
3.Python_Dynamic_Programming_CoinChange/


Inside each folder, you may find:

- `solution.go` / `solution.py` / `solution.java` – Your implementation of the solution.
- `README.md` – Optional notes, explanation, or approach for that problem.
- `tests/` – Optional test cases for verification.

---

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder of the topic/problem you want to study.
2. Open the solution file to review the code.
3. Check the folder README (if present) for explanations or approach notes.
4. Run the code in your local environment to test and experiment.

## Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills across **arrays, strings, trees, graphs, hash tables, dynamic programming**, and other DSA topics.
- Maintain a structured record of practice problems and solutions.
- Track personal progress and revisit problems as needed.

---

## Notes

- Problems are from multiple sources, but **folder names are consistent by topic/problem**.
- Solutions are meant for **learning and self-study** purposes. Please do not copy for competitive submissions or assignments.
